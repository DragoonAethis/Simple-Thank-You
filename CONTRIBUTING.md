### Reporting
Before you report a new issue, make sure you look at the existing ones first to avoid creating duplicates. You can use Search with some keywords too.

### Contributing as a developer
Some instructions about code style and everything that has to be done to increase the change of your code getting accepted can be found at the [General Discussion](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/General-Discussion#contribution-rules-for-developers) section. 

### Contributing as a non developer
